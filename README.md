##### Description:

>This is a simple python quiz app written in the Flask framework.
It simply compares two instances and returns a feedback to the user.
This app employs the use of dictionaries, loops and some templating, 
which is easily propagated through the flask framework. 
After a user answers all questions they make their way unto the scoreboard.

##### Technologies:
This app was created using the python Flask micro-framework for the back-end engine.
By the use of various flask extensions, automation can easily be achieved. In this project i employed these extension:
Flask==1.0.2
Jinja2==2.10
MarkupSafe==1.0
Werkzeug==0.14.1
click==6.7
itsdangerous==0.24
For the front-end i used HTML5, bootstrap4 and CSS3.
