#####Description:

>This is a simple python quiz app written in the Flask framework.
It simply compares two instances and returns a feedback to the user.
This app employs the use of dictionaries, loops and some templating, 
which is easily propagated through the flask framework. 
After a user answers all questions they make their way unto the scoreboard.
